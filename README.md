# Embedded-Video-URL-Finder-Python-
This small Python program analize the html code of a web, and locates the url of an embedded video.

The program will require an URL; and it will answer with the URL embedded on them.
The text that appears to request the URL is in spanish. (i'm spanish).  if you don't understand it, just insert the URL after the first message

We have worked with this page as an example:
https://www.herokidstudio.es/

KNOWN ISSUES:

It works perfectly on the page used as an example (on the date when i write this), BUT it will not work in other tested pages. 
This is not a problem of the code, but due to the fact that every page is different.
Some people use "iframe" instead of "video" in his html code.  Some people use src="xxx.mp4" instead of data-source="xxx.mp4". Some people use another, different terms.

Adittionaly many pages have protection against that.


So this code is just an example made for fun and practice.  It's valid for this page and perhaps for other ones but not for all.

Fell free to use it and adapt it if you want (always being respectfull about privacy,copyright, etc.)
